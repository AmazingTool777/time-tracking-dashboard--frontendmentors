## My thoughts

This was a pretty easy challenge for me and the challenge is also ranked as a **Junior** level one.  
Nonetheless, the challenge got me working mostly on [CSS grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout).  
Overall, the challenge was fun and it was satisfying to make the HTML version of such a great simple yet well-crafted design alive.

Peace out! üòÅüëå
